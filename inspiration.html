		<h2><i>To my friends,</i></h2>
		<p>"I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In other's eyes, my life is an epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death. In the darkness, I look at the green lights from the life supporting machines and hear the humming mechanical sounds, I feel the breath of god of death drawing closer. Now I know, when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime, we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth. Should be something that is more important. Perhaps relationships, perhaps art, perhaps a dream from younger days. Non-stop pursuing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me. God gave us the senses to let us feel the love in everyone's heart, not the illusions brought about by wealth. The wealth that I have won in my life I cannot bring with me. What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love. That's the true riches which will follow you, accompany you, giving you strength and light to go on. Love can travel a thousand miles. Life has no limits. Go where you want to go. Reach the height you want to reach. It is all in your heart and in your hands. What is the most expensive bed in the world? "Sick bed". You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you. Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost - "Life". When a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading - "Book of Healthy Life". Whichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down. Treasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends. Treat yourself well. Cherish others.‚Äù	- <i>Steve Jobs</i></p>
		<i>Time</i><br><br>
		Do not spend it but use it<br>
		Be always 15 minutes early<br>
		Make three things to do everyday and complete them before you sleep<br><br>
		<i>Experience</i><br><br>
		Experience everything bad and good then judge what is right and wrong<br>
		Abide by law, but break your frame<br>
		Misfortune it is also an experience<br>
		Sometimes do whatever you feel like to do then learn from it<br><br>
		<i>Dignity</i><br><br>
		Be humble<br>
		Resist and finish it<br>
		Greeting and clothes are classes<br>
		Use 'thanks to' rather than 'because of'<br>
		Help others even if you do not like to you will learn more from it<br>
		Be thankful to everything<br><br>
