		<h2> About me</h2>
		<p>Hello, I am Deahan. I am a first-year MHI student. During my undergraduate years, I took two years off to complete Korean national military service, in which I served as an assistant instructor for basic training. I helped transform civilians into soldiers and trained more than 3500 Privates. The motto of our camp was “lead by example”. I always felt tension and did what I am supposed to do because I was the first soldier seen by new soldiers. Due to my effort, I became a squad leader. I was excited about the increased responsibilities, including managing soldiers’ paychecks, leaves and promotions, and participating staff meetings. </p>
		<p>In addition, I started a public service activity. Volunteered soldiers and I, under my command, went to care for children and elderly from low-income families. Their conditions were extremely wretched. There was a marked disconnect. The Health and Welfare Bureau publicized statistics to emphasize how their support was effective and helped underprivileged families. I observed that the welfare benefits for these groups were exaggerated and that the method of collecting and managing data seemed disorganized and improperly executed. I could not take such misconception, especially when I believed in righteousness and “lead by example.” Despite the distortion, I did my duty; I managed my squad to really help the people as much as possible. My goal became the analysis of health related data to improve individual health. When I returned to university, I studied Statistics to be ready for the next step. Studying Health Informatics, I want to develop greater knowledge and discover new innovations that can benefit humankind. In the end, I want to become a professor so that I continue scrutinizing my research to benefit humankind.</p>
